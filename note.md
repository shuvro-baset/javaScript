# todo: arrow function
    -JavaScript arrow functions are roughly the equivalent of lambda functions in python
    - Arrow functions allow a developer to accomplish the same result with fewer lines of code and approximately half the typing.
    -Arguments objects are not available in arrow functions, but are available in regular functions.
    ------ When Not to Use Arrow Function: ------
        -->in object method don't use arrow functions
        -->Callback functions with dynamic context
        -->When it makes your code less readable
